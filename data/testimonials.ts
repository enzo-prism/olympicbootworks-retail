      "I was having issues with plantar fasciitis, especially after playing pickleball multiple days in a row. After getting orthotics for both my ski boots and pickleball shoes, it was a game changer. I played 4 straight days of pickleball, then two days of skiing, followed by 2 more days of pickleball, without my feet bothering me at all. I've noticed less hip and back pain as well.",

      'I am a 25+ year snowboarder who decided it would be a great idea to learn to ski this year. I was struggling with baggy feeling boots and a lot of discomfort/pain but I sort of thought that was normal with ski boots. I decided to do a little more research to see if there was a way to make these boots work for me (they were "the right size" after all - I had been "fitted" by a very kind and attentive person at REI). I ended up calling Olympic Bootworks in South Lake Tahoe and spoke to Joel. I shared with him my struggles with the current boots and also that I was surprised how hard it was to learn to ski. Within a few minutes of talking to me, he diagnosed my problem over the phone. I made the trek up to South Lake the following week to see him in person. I had THE BEST experience in the shop - reminded me of the vibe of the surf and skate shops I used to work at in the 90s. Joel remembered speaking with me and was quick to help. He measured my feet, watched me walk and examined my physiology / how my knees and feet worked in concert with one another. Within a short time he got me set with a pair of boots that was the actual right size for me. He then took the time to fit me for custom footbeds for the boots. I have worn orthotics for the better part of the last two decades and am very well versed in recognizing who knows what they are doing. Joel knows exactly what he is doing. These foot beds essentially transformed an off the shelf boot and liner into a custom boot. WOW. I was able to go skiing a couple days later and had THE BIGGEST breakthrough with progression and was actually able to link turns and figured out how to hockey stop. That gave me so much confidence in my ability to learn something new at 42. Our three kids will be graduating from season rental gear next year. Olympic Bootworks will be our first stop for all three of them to get them outfitted. If your foundation isn\'t proper, nothing else will be stable. I am so enthused about this operation and the guys that work there! Everyone that came in during my time in the shop was as enthusiastic about their services and abilities as I am now! It is worth EVERY penny to upgrade your boots and footbeds.',

      "CINDERELLA! THE SHOE FINALLY FITS! This place rocks. The most knowledgeable, friendly, professional, welcoming boot shop around. These guys really know their stuff and are super informative without making you feel silly when you ask a million questions. I came in with old boots that were causing me pain and making me tap out of skiing early in the day. I found out were too wide for my feet and the liner was not doing me any favors. Jason gave me the run down on my foot shape, and fitted me in a snug Lange boot. I opted for the shop's proprietary heel-loc foot beds that that Jason form fitted to my high arch to give me more support. After a week of skiing, I could feel the difference but I brought my boots in the get worked on in toe box and Levi did god's work and put up with my endless questions about liners, heat molding, how to properly buckle my boots, etc. I opted for the zip fit liners and will never look back. The whole crew here is great and I cannot recommend this shop enough. Seriously life changing!",

      "Great shop, awesome staff. If you have never had boots fitted for your foot by a professional fitter but only ski shop sales people, STOP, your boot is your most important part of skiing. Wolfy went over and above getting me into a new set of Tecnica Cochise 130 HV that fit better than any boot I've ever had fitted over the last 40+ years. I wanted a boot for 80% off piste resort skiing and 20% backcountry to work with my Shift2 bindings and stiff enough for hard charging down West Face Alternates. He did the inspection with my foot in the empty shell to get the right fit (if your boot fitter doesn't do this, walk away). His knowledge and discussion of materials and what can be done for a proper fit are exemplary. I highly recommend this shop and Wolfy for your boot fitting needs!",

      "Got my first pair of boots here with their custom footbeds after some friends recommended it. They fit me in a really tight shell (as they should :P) which was a bit painful to ski in at first but after taking them back to get them punched out, the footbeds shaved down a bit, and some liner modifications, the fit is perfect. Really appreciate their commitment to modifying the boot until it fits perfectly. Eventually added booster straps and zipfits and they did a great job with these as well. My boots are amazing now. Staff is friendly and super knowledgeable and it's an awesome local small business vibe in there. Would recommend to anyone who skis Tahoe regularly since you might have to try skiing the boots and taking them back in for adjustments a few of times before you're totally satisfied.",

      "Incredible expertise, phenomenal technology in Heel-Loc. After 45 years of skiing I didn't think anything could ever solve my boot fit problems. Boy was I wrong. Revolutionized my stance, power transfer, and stability. Dropping into Gunsight and High Greely at Alta finally became a story about skill and no longer about equipment.",

      "Went here a Colin was a true master of his craft. Got me fitted into an excellent boot with how I ski, made sure to get the proper footbeds for my exaggerated arch, and explained everything to me with care and detail. Olympic Bootworks has earned a life-long customer.",

      "Couldn't say enough good stuff about this crew. Got me into a boot and I ended up having some pretty bad foot pains on run 1. Brought them back in and got it punched out, and I feel like I could ski anything now. I was there for a couple of hours working on getting the punches correct, they never made me feel bad about it and now my boot fits perfectly now. Thanks Sam! I've had so many friends that got fitted in the Bay Area, then have boot issues when they ski and have their trips ruined. Olympic boot works being right next to the mountain is such a huge benefit because of this.",

      "I was having pain with my boots on the mountain, came off the mountain at 4 and got to the shop at 4:45. Although the shops closes at 5, and there were 3,4 people in front of me. Brent was still able to squeeze me in for a bit of diagnosis and gave me couple of suggestions to help mitigate the pain and ask me to ski another day to see how I feel. I came back the next day after skiing and Sam was there to adjust my boots with no problem. Absolutely the best shop out there. Everyone is nice and helpful in every way possible! Highly recommended!!",

      "I rented gear for my first season of skiing, and wasn't sure if I was being silly by going to a fancy place to buy boots for season #2. As someone who is still getting to know all of the gear options available, Colin was very helpful. Most importantly, the boots he found for me fit much more precisely than my rentals, and have definitely improved my skiing. I could have found the same boots (admittedly without the custom footbeds) online for quite a bit less, but without the fitting I would never have known what to buy. Money well spent, and I'll probably be coming back if I ever get into backcountry... or want to say hi to the shop dog again!",

      "This was the second time I have worked with Buck at Olympic Boot Works. I have been to various orthotic locations for custom builds. Buck's pricing and attention to detail is the best in the business. They are also made quickly and are guaranteed to last. I have a pair for everyday use and a pair for golfing. I will be purchasing a pair for my ski boots as well. He is able to cover whatever needs that you need support in. The custom fitting and the time he takes with you to make sure each orthotic is built and shaped to your needs is the best experience you can find. I would recommend anyone to go see Buck.",

      'Far and away the best experience I\'ve had with a bootfitter. Foot pain has limited my "fun" factor of skiing for many years and several (pricey!) fittings. I was starting to feel defeated, but heard top reviews of Olympic Bootworks and gave them a try. So glad I did!',
